# Web3 Payment System Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the Web3 payment system to use transaction hash verification instead of memo-based transactions. Users now send USDT and paste their transaction hash to confirm payments.

## Backend Changes (mmekoapi/Controller/accountPayment/web3payment.js)

### ‚úÖ Completed Changes:

1. **Removed Memo Logic**
   - Removed `parseTransactionMemo()` and `extractOrderIdFromMemo()` functions
   - Removed memo-based transaction matching
   - Simplified Web3 listener to only initialize connection

2. **Added Transaction Hash Verification**
   - New `verifyTransactionHash()` function that:
     - Validates transaction exists on blockchain
     - Checks transaction was successful
     - Verifies transaction was sent to our wallet
     - Extracts USDT transfer amount from transaction logs
     - Returns detailed transaction information

3. **Added Payment Expiry System**
   - Payments now expire after 30 minutes
   - Added `expiresAt` field to payment records
   - New `processExpiredPayments()` function for cron job
   - Manual trigger endpoint for testing

4. **Updated Payment Creation**
   - Added 30-minute expiry time to new payments
   - Updated instructions to mention transaction hash verification
   - Removed memo-related instructions

5. **New API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/payment/web3/verify-tx` - Verify transaction hash
   - `POST /api/payment/web3/process-expired` - Manual expired payment processing

### üîß Updated Routes (mmekoapi/routes/api/payment/web3.routes.js)
- Removed old memo-based endpoints
- Added new transaction hash verification endpoint
- Added expired payment processing endpoint

## Frontend Changes (mmekowebsite/src/app/buy-gold/page.tsx)

### ‚úÖ Completed Changes:

1. **Updated UI Components**
   - Replaced memo-based payment details with transaction hash input
   - Added countdown timer showing payment expiry
   - Removed order ID copy functionality (no longer needed)
   - Updated instructions to guide users on getting transaction hash

2. **Added Countdown Timer**
   - Real-time countdown showing time remaining
   - Automatic payment cancellation when expired
   - Visual indicators (red pulsing dot) when time is running out

3. **Transaction Hash Verification**
   - Input field for users to paste transaction hash
   - Verify button with loading states
   - Error handling for invalid transaction hashes
   - Success feedback when payment is confirmed

4. **Updated State Management**
   - Added `txHash` state for transaction hash input
   - Added `verifyingTx` state for verification loading
   - Added `timeLeft` state for countdown timer
   - Proper cleanup when payment is completed/cancelled

### üîß Updated API Client (mmekowebsite/src/api/web3payment.ts)
- Added `verifyTransactionHash()` function
- Updated interfaces to include `expiresAt` and transaction hash fields
- Removed old memo-based verification function

## Cron Job Setup

### üìã Required Setup:

1. **Install node-cron dependency:**
   ```bash
   cd mmekoapi
   npm install node-cron
   ```

2. **Start the cron job in your main server file (index.js):**
   ```javascript
   const { startExpiredPaymentsCron } = require('./scripts/processExpiredWeb3Payments');
   
   // Start the cron job after server initialization
   startExpiredPaymentsCron();
   ```

3. **The cron job will:**
   - Run every minute
   - Check for payments that have expired
   - Automatically mark them as 'expired'
   - Log the processing results

## New Payment Flow

### üîÑ User Experience:

1. **Create Payment**
   - User selects gold pack and creates Web3 payment
   - System shows wallet address and 30-minute countdown
   - Payment is created with 'waiting' status

2. **Send USDT**
   - User sends exact USDT amount to provided wallet address
   - User copies transaction hash from their wallet/blockchain explorer

3. **Verify Transaction**
   - User pastes transaction hash in the input field
   - System verifies transaction on blockchain
   - If valid, payment is confirmed and gold is credited
   - If invalid, user gets error message

4. **Automatic Expiry**
   - If user doesn't verify within 30 minutes, payment expires
   - User must create a new payment to try again

## Security Features

### üîí Enhanced Security:

1. **Blockchain Verification**
   - All transactions are verified on-chain
   - No reliance on user-provided data alone
   - Amount matching prevents partial payments

2. **Time-based Expiry**
   - Prevents indefinite pending payments
   - Reduces system load from abandoned payments
   - Forces users to complete payments promptly

3. **Transaction Validation**
   - Verifies transaction was successful
   - Checks transaction was sent to correct wallet
   - Validates USDT transfer amount matches expected amount

## Testing

### üß™ Test Scenarios:

1. **Valid Transaction**
   - Send correct USDT amount
   - Paste valid transaction hash
   - Should confirm payment and credit gold

2. **Invalid Transaction Hash**
   - Paste non-existent transaction hash
   - Should show "Transaction not found" error

3. **Wrong Amount**
   - Send different USDT amount
   - Should show "Amount mismatch" error

4. **Expired Payment**
   - Wait 30+ minutes without verifying
   - Should show "Payment expired" error

5. **Already Confirmed**
   - Try to verify already confirmed payment
   - Should show "Payment already confirmed"

## Environment Variables

### üìù Required Environment Variables:

```env
RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
WALLET_ADDRESS=your_bsc_wallet_address
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
```

### üîë How to Get Etherscan API Key:
1. Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Go to API-KEYs section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key to your environment variables
