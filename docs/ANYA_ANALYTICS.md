## Data Flow

1. **User selects period** → Frontend makes GET request to `/api/ai-story/analytics?period={period}`
2. **Backend**:
   - Calculates date range based on period
   - Queries MongoDB for stories within that range
   - Processes and aggregates data:
     - Calculates totals and averages
     - Groups by day for daily metrics
     - Sorts stories by different metrics
     - Finds peak days and top stories
3. **Frontend receives response** → Displays in charts, cards, and tables

## Usage

### For Administrators:
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard (`/mmeko/admin`)
2. Click on "Anya Analytics" in the sidebar
3. Select desired time period from dropdown
4. View comprehensive metrics and charts
5. Switch between top stories tabs (Likes/Views/Comments)

### Metrics Tracked:
- **Engagement**: How users interact (likes + comments)
- **Reach**: How many views stories get
- **Performance**: Which stories perform best
- **Trends**: Daily patterns and peak days
- **Growth**: Story creation trends over time

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used:
